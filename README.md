# rustea

`rustea` is a small cli tool for handling configuration and script files. Thus, it shall be simple
to pull or deploy configurations directly from a Gitea instance or push configurations to it.
It doesn't aim to replace full-fledged configuration management system. If your looking
for such an approach use a tool like Ansible or Chef or something else like that.

## Overview

`rustea` uses a git like semantics where configurations are either pushed to some Gitea instance
or pulled to the local machine and copied to the correct place. It distinguishes between simple
files and __script files__ which are simply executable files stored in a special location.
As a remote store for the files a Gitea server with an enabled API is used.

#### Non-Goals

  * compete with full-fledged configuration management systems
  * regular update of operating systems and distribution packages
  * repair broken configurations
  * Branches and in deepth Gitea or Git Features (maybe on request)
  * No authentication is used

### Why?

The main idea behind `rustea` is to have a single static binary for configuration or feature management
of *nix machines. It shall allow version control but without the need of having a local `git` installation
which is quite large. Most configuration systems depend on open ports or `ssh` installed and configured on
the target machine. 

Gitea is a lightwight and fast Github and Gitlab alternative written as a single go binary. It has an extensive
API with a good __swagger__ documentation. Alternative backends such as Github are also possible (maybe on request).

### Repository

`rustea` is build around the idea to use a single repository for configuration managment. The repository contains
so called feature sets which defines configuration files and/or script files for a single feature. For example,
a feature set can be `php` with the only configuration file `/etc/php/php.ini`. A more complex example can be the
feature `mail-server` which contains dozen of configuration files for `postfix`, `dovecot`, `postgres`, `rspamd` and
self-made __script files__ for adding users or domains to the mail server.

The following is an example repository:

    Devops Repository:
    |- File_1 <-- ignored
    |- File_2 <-- ignored
    +- feature_set_1/
       +- scripts/ <-- folder containing script files
          |- script_1
          |- script_2
       |- feature_1/ <-- A feature set contains feature folders
       |- feature_2/ <-- The feature folder path is the resulting path in the fs.
    +- feature_set_2/
       |- feature_1/ <-- For example, /etc/postfix/ is stored remotely under mail/etc/postfix/
       |- File_1 <-- Is deployed under /

As one can see, files in the root directory are ignored. A feature set lives within a folder denoted by
the name of the feature set. Within a feature set __script files__ are placed directly in the folder `scripts`.
Configuration files are placed in the feature set with its full path. This enables rustea to simply copy
the files directly to the appropriate position on a local machine. The drawback is that differences between
linux distributions or between operating systems are not handled. Files directly stored in a feature set
are placed under `/`.

The following list gives some assumptions while developing `rustea`:
  * `rustea` uses a single repository
  * feature sets are stored in a folder by their name
  * __script files__ are stored in `feature_set/scripts/`
  * configuration files are canonicolized and stored in `feature_set/full/path/to/config/file`
  * The destination of __script files__ is configurable
  * Token authentication is used for every request
  * Pull operations are collective operations for all __script files__ and/or configuration files
  * `rustea` is called as root or with sudo if the configuration files are stored in sensible locations
  * `.gitkeep` is used to store empty feature sets and script folders

An example for the main configuration which is stored under `~/.rustea.toml`:

    script_folder = '/etc/local/bin' <-- Local folder for script files
    
    [repo]
    url = 'https://git.rtzptz.xyz' <-- Base url to the gitea instance without trailing /
    repository = 'rustea-devops' <-- Repository name
    owner = 'Juerges' <-- Repository owner
    api_token = 'xxxxx' <-- Provided or created by the initialization of rustea
    author = "Henrik JÃ¼rges" <-- Should match with some Username but everything is allowed
    email = "example@rtzptz.xyz" <-- Change after initialization
    
The API token can be requested while initializing `rustea` which also creates the initial configuration.
The name and email address are used for commiting.

## Installation and Usage

Either grab a pre-build copy:

    curl -L https://github.com/santifa/rustea/releases/download/v0.1.1/rustea-min > /usr/local/bin/rustea

or build `rustea` on your own:

    git clone https://github.com/santifa/rustea.git
    cd rustea
    cargo build --release

Now you can create a new repository within in your Gitea Instance. 
__!!! Be aware that you must initialize your repository with some README.md or something else.
An empty repository refuses to add new files via API !!!__

Afterwards, you can either create the `~/.rustea.toml` by yourself or run `rustea init --name <TOKEN-NAME> <URL> <REPO> <OWNER>`.

`rustea` uses some optimization for the binary size: [[Ref]](https://arusahni.net/blog/2020/03/optimizing-rust-binary-size.html), [[Ref]](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust)

  * [x] build in release mode
  + [x] Strip symbols from binary (`cargo install --force cargo-strip && cargo strip`)
  * [x] Optimization for size with  `opt-level = "s"`
  * [x] Link-time Optimization with `lto = true`
  * [x] Reduce parallel code building with `codegen-units = 1`
  * [x] Abort on panic instead of unwind the stack with `panic = 'abort'`
  * [ ] Use xargo for `std`
  * [ ] Remove `libstd`
  * [x] Strip symbols with `cargo-strip` 
  * [x] Compress the binary with upx

The last two options can lead to insufficient error messsages and virus scanner alert. 
Thus, two version are provided with and without striped symbols and compression.

## Development

This crate is still young and under active usage and development.

### Tests

The test can be run with `cargo test`. The integration tests assume a configured `rustea.toml` in
the project root which points to an empty remote repository.

### Todo's

A small list of features that came in my mind:
  * [x] Commit messages from `rustea`
  * [x] Use binary format for reading files
  * [x] self-updater
  * [ ] Rename features set, files or folder on the remote repository
  * [ ] set symlink files (e.g. for cron-jobs)
  * [x] better terminal support (better display of tables)
  * [ ] installing packages, distribution agnostic?
  * [+] Ignore specific files like `.git` (only git files hardcoded)
  * [x] Pull single configuration or script files from a feature set
  * [ ] Provide other backends like Gitlab or Github
  * [ ] Show diff between the local and remote configuration
  * [ ] More extensives tests
  * [ ] feature set and local folder diff
  * [ ] Scripts should be executable
  * [x] Replace (https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.11.4/reqwest/index.html)[`reqwest`] with something smaller; (https://docs.rs/curl/0.4.38/curl/index.html)[curl-bindings], (https://github.com/algesten/ureq)[ureq]

### Workflows

These are the main workflows which I used to describe the usage 
of `rustea` from a user perspective.

*Prepare rustea*
  * Fetch the binary from somewhere
  * Create an inital configuration in `~/.rustea.toml` with `rustea`:
      * The user has an api token for gitea `rustea init --token <key> <url> <repository> <owner>`
      * The user request a new API key with `rustea init --name <token_name> <url> <repository> <owner>`
          * The user enters username and password when asked and the token is requested 
  * The configuration file is stored under `~/.rustea.toml` by default
      
*Show informations*
  * The user can show informations about the gitea instance and the repository with `rustea info`
  * The user can list all feature-sets in the repository with `rustea list`
  * The user can list all script and config files of a feature set with `rustea list <name>`

*Add a new feature set*
  * The user creates a new feature set with `rustea new <feature set name>`
  * This creates a new folder in the devops repository with `<name>/.gitkeep`
  
*Delete a feature set*
  * The user can delete a feature set with `rustea delete <feature set name>`
  * This deletes the folder `<name>/` and everything below, be carefull.

*Delete a config file from a feature set*
  * The user can delete files or folders from a feature set with `rustea delete <fs-name> <path>`
  * Use `-r` for recursive deletes
  * The files or folders are only deleted within the remote repository

*Delete a script file from a feature set*
  * The user can delete a script file from a feature set with `rustea delete --script <fs-name> <script-name>`

*Add scripts to a feature set*
  * The user adds script files to a feature set with `rustea push --script <fs-name> <path to file or folder>`
  * `rustea` either takes the file and uploads it to `<fs-name>/scripts/<filename>` or if given a folder `rustea` uploads all files inside to `<fs-name>/scripts/`

*Add config files to a feature set*
  * The user adds configuration files to a feature set with `rustea push <fs-name> <path to file or folder>`
  * A config file is stored under `<fs-name>/path/to/config-file`
  * All files in a config folder are stored under `<fs-name>/path/to/folder/`
  * The absolute path of a file is determined

*Update the configuration files*
  * The user may change local configuration files and want to upload the changes
  * The user pushes all configuration files with `rustea push <fs-name>`
  * The needed configuration files are determined from the remote repository path 
  * Script files are searched in `/usr/local/bin/`, if the file is located somewhere else use `rustea push --script ...`

*Deploy a feature set to the machine*
  * The user deploys a feature set with `rustea pull <fs-name>`
      * For only deploying script files use `rustea pull --script <fs-name>`
      * For only deploying configuration files use `rustea pull --config <fs-name>`
      * Use `rustea pull <fs-name> <path>` for pulling a single file or folder from the feature set
      * The path is the absolute or relative path of the file or folder on the filesystem. 
  * `rustea` fetches the content of the feature set and copies script files to `/usr/local/bin`
    and configration files to their repository path name without the feature set name
  * Local copies are overwritten
  * Sudo is required if the files are copied into filesystem regions where the user has no rights
